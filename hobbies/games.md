# Games
My friend Mary and I have been playing games together since ~2019. Initially it started as just the Yale Daily News crossword (I believe it was or is a syndicate of the LA Times crossword puzzles). Since campus shutdown in 2020, we no longer live in the same place. Nonetheless, we have maintained our streak of doing the crossword together (nearly) every day since. These days our core crossword is the New York Times daily crossword. We have added a bevy of other games to our daily and weekly games rotation.
* NYT daily crossword
* NYT spelling bee
* [Minute Cryptic](https://www.minutecryptic.com/) crosswords
* [Redactle](https://redactle.net/)
* [Metazooa](https://metazooa.com/)
* [Bandle](https://bandle.app/)

We also often participate in the semi-annual [Boswords](https://www.boswords.org/) crossword competitions.
We individually compete in [LearnedLeague](https://www.learnedleague.com/).

If you have other games to recommend, let us know!
